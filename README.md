# jacobeli.dev

[jacobeli.dev](https://jacobeli.dev) is my personal portfolio website, originally built with vanilla [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), and then migrating to SvelteKit to take advantage of routing and other full-stack capabilities after the site's functionality grew. Design in collaboration with [Sean Makura](https://seanmakura.webflow.io/).
